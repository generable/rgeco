\arguments{
\item{project}{Project name}

\item{project_version_id}{Project version. If this is specified, the `project` argument is ignored.}

\item{model_type}{(character vector) filter to runs with this model type, as one of: joint, survival, biomarker. NULL to disable this filter.}

\item{model_version}{(character vector) filter to runs with this model version string. NULL to disable this filter.}

\item{min_draws}{(scalar int) filter to runs with >= this many draws combined across all chains. NULL to disable this filter.}

\item{extra_fields}{(character vector) names of additional fields to include in the summary. See results of \code{\link{list_datasets}}, \code{\link{list_runs}}, and \code{\link{list_models}} for available fields.}
}
\value{
a data frame with key metadata about the run.

\description{
This function is a higher-level wrapper around \code{\link{list_runs}} to aid in run discovery
}
\details{
A run is generated by a model and a dataset. This function retrieves the
key features for all runs meeting certain criteria within a project version.

The returned `data.frame` combines information about the run, model, and datasets
for each run.

Authentication (see \code{\link{login}}) is required prior to using this function
and this pulls the list of parameter names from the Generable API.
